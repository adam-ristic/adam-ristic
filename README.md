## Hi! I'm Adam, an aspiring Software Developer. 👋

🧠 Currently a student within the Software Development program at Mohawk College, I'm always looking to learn new things to use on my own personal projects. I love taking simple ideas and making them reality!

🛠️ My current go-to toolkit includes plain old Javascript and PHP for web development, as well as C# or Java for any desktop apps.

## About Me

🔭 I’m currently working on a portfolio website! Unfortunately it won't be finished until next time :(

🌱 I’m currently learning React and ASP.NET
